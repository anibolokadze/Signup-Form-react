Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
- Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks    like this is not an email"*
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
